## Usage-Bot
Commands are prefixed with ยง
- time:
  - date as [year]-[month]-[day] (example 2023-07-05)
  - time as [hour]:[minute] (example 09:30)
  - offset as +/-[hour]:[minute] (example 02:00 or -02:00)
    - this is a UTC offset by default
    - Supports some Named timezones by their shorthands
      - (i.e. CEST GMT EET)
      - Since Timezone names overlap I recommend using UTC offset.
